    <p>Here's a list of foods that would turn any day to christmas for Bosco:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Kienyeji chicken</li>
      <li>Rabbits</li>
      <li>Rare beef steak</li>
      <li>Some damn packaged dog food</li>
    </ol>
      <p>As Bosco, I've indulge myself in the simple pleasures of life.
        Find me doing round throughout your hood in the early mornings,
        or find me chilling under your car during the hot lazy afternoons.
        If you are an evening person like I am, find me chilling at your local mtura ya damu joint
        eargely awaiting for you to drop a piece of the treasured African sausage.
