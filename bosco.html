      <li>Rabbits</li>
      <li>Rare beef steak</li>
      <li>Some damn packaged dog food</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I know how you humans love pretending, so just so that you don't say
        you don't know what I'm talking about, imma leave you some photos.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Would you just look at her.</p></li>

          <li><p>It wouldn't hurt you if you gave me a piece of the one cooking in your sufuria though.</p></li>
            <img src="images/kuku kienyeji fry.jpeg" alt="Kienyeji chicken fry">
          <li><p>That figure is a killer. A shame you never want me to get a taste.</p></li>
            <img src="images/rabbit meat.jpeg" alt="rabbit meat">
          <li><p>Done just to my liking. My tongue is already hanging outside my mouth.</p></li>
            <img src="images/rare steak.jpeg" alt="rare beef steak">
          <li><p>I've seen what you're doing for others lord. I hope some cereal for breakfast ain't much to ask for.</p></li>
            <img src="images/packed dog food.jpeg" alt="packaged dog feeds">
          <li><p>This is the main reason my owner couldn't afford to sustain me. If he saved half the money he spent here, he could be a landlord in the metropolis by now.</p></li>

        </ul>



    <p>As Bosco, I love indulging myself in the simple pleasures of life. Raha najipa mwenyewe!
        Find me doing rounds throughout your hood in the early mornings,
        or find me chilling under your car during the hot lazy afternoons.
        If you are an evening person like I am, find me chilling at your local mtura ya damu joint
        eargely awaiting for you to drop me a piece of the treasured African sausage.
        Have some humanity in you bro! I'm only asking for a piece.</p>
